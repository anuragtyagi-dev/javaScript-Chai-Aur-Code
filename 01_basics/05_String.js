// String is the most powerful tool in javaScript 

// Old way of printing string in console
// Example
const userName = "anuragtyagi"
const userCity = "newdelhi"

// console.log(userName + userCity) // This is the old way of adding two or more strings , this is no longer recommended in production level

// IMPORTANT 
// Modern way of adding two or more strings

// console.log(`Hello My Name is ${userName} and my city is ${userCity}`)
// This way is recommend to add multiple strings together

const gameName = new String('anurag_tyagi_dev')

console.log(gameName.length)
console.log(userName.__proto__)

console.log(typeof gameName)
