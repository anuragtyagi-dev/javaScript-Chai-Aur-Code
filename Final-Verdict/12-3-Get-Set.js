The three code blocks you provided have slight differences:

1. This block works correctly - it creates instances of a user object and allows you to access, modify, and uppercase the username:

function User(username) {
    this._username = username;

    Object.defineProperty(this, 'username', {
        get: function() {
            return this._username.toUpperCase();
        },
        set: function(value) {
            this._username = value;
        }
    });
}

const one = new User('anurag');
console.log(one.username);  // Outputs: ANURAG


2. In this code snippet, the username property isn't initialized. It is replaced with mango, but the usage remains the same:

function User(username) {
    this.mango = username;

    Object.defineProperty(this, 'username', {
        get: function() {
            return this.mango.toUpperCase();
        },
        set: function(value) {
            this.mango = value;
        }
    });
}
const one = new User('anurag');
console.log(one.username); // Outputs: ANURAG


Although username wasn't defined directly, you created a getter and a setter for it using Object.defineProperty. For the getter, this.mango will be accessed, not this.username. This encapsulation allows you to store the name under the mango attribute but user-facing access will be through username.

3. This block will cause a TypeError during the execution. Here you replaced username with mango, but the constructor function expects username as a parameter.

function User(username) {
    // this.mango = username; <- this line is missing

    Object.defineProperty(this, 'username', {
        get: function() {
            return this.mango.toUpperCase();
        },
        set: function(value) {
            this.mango = value;
        }
    });
}

const one = new User('anurag');
console.log(one.username);  // Throws TypeError: Cannot read property 'toUpperCase' of undefined 


When you try to get one.username, it will try to call toUpperCase on this.mango, which isn't defined, and an error will be thrown.

I hope that clarifies things. If you have more questions, feel free to ask!
