function user( username){
    this.mango = username
    Object.defineProperty( this, "username", {
        get: function(){
            return this.mango.toUpperCase()
        },
        set: function(value){
            this.mango = value
        }
    })
}
const one = new user("anurag")
console.log(one.username)


// so in 2nd code , as mango is acting in place of username in line this.mango = username; so when we use getter and setter and call username from new object instance , getter and setter automatically assign this.username for that newly constructed object ? is that's what happening


// GPT Answer  : 

/* 
        Yes, you're correct. Let's break it down:

In this code:

function User(username) {
this.mango = username;

Object.defineProperty(this, 'username', {
get: function() {
return this.mango.toUpperCase();
},
set: function(value) {
this.mango = value;
}
});
}
const one = new User('anurag');
console.log(one.username); // Outputs: ANURAG


Object.defineProperty() is used to define new properties or modify existing ones on an object and return the object. The property username is added to the User object through it, with the help of getters and setters.

Getters and setters work:

- get: When you try to access the property, the getter is called and the associated function will be executed. If you call one.username, the getter for username will execute return this.mango.toUpperCase(); and since this.mango = 'anurag', it returns 'ANURAG'.

- set: When you try to set the property with a value, the setter will be called with the value you're trying to assign. one.username = 'John'; will execute the setter function with value = 'John' and set this.mango = 'John'.

So, when you call one.username, the getter/setter mechanism of the username property in the one object is invoked. As the username property in the one object is really referencing this.mango in its getter and setter functions, you're effectively getting or setting this.mango when you access or assign one.username.

This mechanism is a means to control access to an object's properties, allowing us to add additional functionality (like data transformations/validations or logging property access) when a property is accessed or modified.
